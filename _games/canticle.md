Canticle is a head-to-head strategy game that also includes a solo mode. Players score points by combining cards into matching patterns.

Canticle was our entry into this year's <a href="http://www.gencant.com/contest-2018/">GenCant</a> contest sponsored by <a href="https://buttonshygames.com/">ButtonShy Games</a>.

ButtonShy makes portable "wallet games", and so the design challenge is to make a game that may only use the components listed below:

- 12-18 Cards
- Vinyl Wallet
- 4 Panel Rule Sheet (this is a folded rule sheet that is essentially the size of 4 double sided playing cards.)

We've released Canticle as a print-and-play game. You may download and play for free.

- The game files are single-sided
- For best results, use 8.5"x11" heavy paper (110 lb. or higher)
- Print the game card files in either color or black and white
  - <a href="/assets/files/Canticle-Cards.pdf">Download and print the color file</a> (2 pages)
- <a href="/assets/files/Canticle-Rules.pdf">Download and print the rules</a>
  - These are designed to fold for handy storage
