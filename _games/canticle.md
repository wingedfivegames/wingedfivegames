Canticle is a head-to-head strategy game that also includes a solo mode. Players score points by combining cards into matching patterns.

Canticle is our entry into this year's <a href="http://www.gencant.com/contest-2018/">GenCant</a> contest sponsored by <a href="https://buttonshygames.com/">ButtonShy Games</a>.

ButtonShy makes portable "wallet games", and so the design challenge is to make a game that may only use the components listed below:

- 12-18 Cards
- Vinyl Wallet
- 4 Panel Rule Sheet (this is a folded rule sheet that is essentially the size of 4 double sided playing cards.)

After the contest ends, we may release Canticle as a print-and-play game. You can watch our how-to-play video below.
