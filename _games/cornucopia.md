Cornucopia is an expansion to [Terraforming Mars](http://strongholdgames.com/our-games/terraforming-mars/) that is compatible with the base game and all other expansions.

With the addition of Cornucopia, players may build and develop food production facilities on Mars. These food factories produce beneficial actions and effects that strengthen your corporation.

<strong>Food Factories</strong><br />

The <em>Hydroponicum</em> is one of four types of food factories included in the expansion. Each factory type generates 4 of the 8 elements used in the expansion. By matching elements to those found on production modules, you can build your factory's production capacity.

You gain actions for each module you connect to your central factory.

<strong>Production Modules</strong><br />

The <em>Methane Cyclers</em> card is an example of a production module that can be connected to the Hydroponicum. Since the Hydroponicum creates Nitrogen, it can add the Methane Cyclers module which requires Nitrogen or Oxygen.

The production module works like a blue active project card in the main game. Here, you gain 2 megacredits whenever an animal tag is played by any player.

As you expand your factory, your modules can increase their production value by <em>connecting</em> to other modules. A connected module matches its elements on all possible sides of your 3x3 factory grid.
