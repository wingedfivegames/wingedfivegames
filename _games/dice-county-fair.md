Welcome to Dice County! Every autumn, we get together at the county fair. While you’re here, you can dine in the Food Hall, play games in the Midway, and take rides in the Carnival. We’re open from 10 am to 10 pm each day, so be sure to plan your trip and pack in all the fun you can!

You and your friends have gone to the fair together and have agreed to pool your money to ensure that everyone has a good time. You’ve agreed to meet every hour to share stories and buy more tickets, tokens, and coins, which you use to purchase and perform activities at the Fair.

Any number of players may participate. And a solo mode is included.
