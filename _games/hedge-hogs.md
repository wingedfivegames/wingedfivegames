Hedge Hogs! is an abstract strategy and area control game for 2-4 players. The 16x16 game board scales with the number of players.

This family-friendly game takes place on a game board that represents the Public Gardens. Each player wants to beautify the gardens by planting as many flowering hedges as possible.

Players take turns placing plant-eating hedgehogs on the board and then compete to place their flowering hedges within the gardens.

- Place hedgehogs as obstacles
- Score points by playing hedges
- Bonus points for playing in the center area
- No touching hedgehogs or other playersâ€™ hedges
