The diners are getting restless! Chef Carmen is on vacation, leaving behind her recipe box, a full slate of reservations, and a pantry in disarray. Earn a promotion in the kitchen by building a menu, gathering ingredients, and serving your diners the best meal of their lives.

Pantry Panic! is a lightweight set collection game featuring a shared modular tableau. Players selectively reveal and play nine recipes in three categories: Appetizers, Soups, and Entrees. These recipes are laid out in a 3x3 grid that forms the tableau. To complete each recipe, you must find the proper ingredients scattered among four kinds of boxes: Dairy, Meats, Produce, and Mixed. There are nine ingredients, three in each main category: butter, cheese, and cream; chicken, fish, and steak; broccoli, eggplant, and tomato.

Pantry Panic! is for 2-5 players, ages 8 and up, and plays in 20-30 minutes. The game fits in a small box (3.5" x 5.5" x 2") and can be carried easily. Components include: 54 pantry box cards, 18 recipe cards, 104 ingredients mini-cards, 45 player score tokens (in 5 colors), 9 first completion tokens, and 3 menu bonus tokens.

Pantry Panic! Is suitable for players of any skill level and is for fans of games like <em>Ticket to Ride</em> and <em>Splendor</em>.
