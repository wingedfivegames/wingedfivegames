Rhino Rescue is a cooperative game. You and your animal friends have left the safety of your Sanctuary to help save last white rhino. Players work together to cross the game board and reunite with their partners back in the Sanctuary.

Each player will take on one animal role, as indicated by color. The yellow and black Rhino token is special, and is controlled by all players in concert. The longer you take to rescue the Rhino, the angrier it will get. Too angry and the Rhino runs away and the game is over.

Game board tiles are double sided. At the start, all tiles indicate green jungle, representing unexplored territory. The flip side of the tile has three options, indicating how many players may occupy the tile at the same time.

The primary action in the game is purchasing and using cards from the Marketplace. A typical Marketplace may look like so:

The number indicates the cost of the card. The description indicates the action that the player may take when playing the card.

The goal of the game is for all players and the Rhino to return to the Sanctuary. The game ends when this goal is met or the Rhino Rage meter rises above 20. Each player also has a private Goal card. To win the game, players must achieve the goal stated on their card.
