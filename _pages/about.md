Winged Five Games are an Augusta, Georgia based LLC. Our founding member, Ken Rickard, serves as principal game designer.

We make card games for 2 - 4 players (4 - 8 with team-based expansions).

In our games, players take on character roles and compete to win the objectives of the game. Players compete to win objectives by managing their hand and playing appropriate bonus and penalty cards.

Our games are designed to be learned in less than 5 minutes. A full game should take 20 - 30 minutes.

We are currently in development on our first project, expected to launch on Kickstarter in October.
