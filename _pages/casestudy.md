Our first game replays the Cold War struggle for Europe. Playing as an American president or Soviet premier, players compete to persuade nations to join their alliance. 2 - 5 players can compete.

Each player takes on the role of a Leader, who has influence ratings in three areas: Economy, Military, and Science.

Each nation card is ranked with a point value and an influence category. Italy, for instance, is worth 8 points and influenced by Military strength.

Each round, players compete to win a single nation as their ally. Players have five Action cards in their hands, and play one per turn until the ally is won. At the end of the game, the player whose allies have the highest total value wins.

It's a quick but complex game featuring multiple strategy choices. Using <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2020/simultaneous-action-selection">Simultaneous Action Selection</a> and <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2686/take">Take That</a> attack and defend mechanics, the game never plays the same way twice.

We started production with simple hand-written note cards, progressing to printed cardstock for better playtesting.

The artwork shown above is preliminary, and gives a good sense of the final tone and direction of the game. We're currently testing color and font combinations to ensure readability and playability.

We're also working on the partners expansion pack, which lets players team up and introduces additional leaders and actions to the gameplay.
