Game concepts
====
In addition to developing our own games, we work with businesses to create custom promotional games.

We craft the actions and themes of the game to suit your promotional or training needs. Our game models work well for multiple uses:

* Marketing
  * Custom branded promotional games
  * Customer thank-you and souvenir games.
* Education
  * Historical simulations
  * Creative gameplay
* Service Organizations
  * Misson-based branding
  * Civic-oriented game objectives
* Training
  * Concept identification
  * Subject mastery

Check out <a href="/games/rhino-rescue/">Rhino Rescue</a> for an in-progress example of games for corporate clients.
